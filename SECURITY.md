# Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure

If you think you have found a vulnerability, please report responsibly. Don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to [queue@open.gov.sg](mailto:queue@open.gov.sg) and we'll look into it immediately.

We appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that might impact the integrity of our platforms and users. While we do not offer any bounties or swags, we'll be very grateful for your help and support.
